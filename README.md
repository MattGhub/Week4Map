Week 4 Map, Los Angeles Asian Population
A brief look at some Asian ethnicities in Los Angeles, California.  Several smaller populations are combined together.  Many smaller populations are ignored.
The plot shows nothing useful, but looks cool and is an example of a bad plot.
The map helps to visualize the largest sub-ethnicity by tract.
